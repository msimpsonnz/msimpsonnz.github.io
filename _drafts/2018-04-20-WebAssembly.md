title: Web Assembly as the next UI Framework

## Using the browser as defacto client

[Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org) (WASM) was first announced way back in 2015, since then it has continued to gain traction and more recently 1.0 has shipped with support for all 4 of the major browsers - Chrome, Edge, Firefox and WebKit

Why do I care? This allows us to use a language that we might be more familiar with to compile down to a binary that we can ship to the browser to run.

Some people believe that JavaScript is the only option for building modern web applications, but just given the number of frameworks and sheer number of ways to build these apps its clear that not everyone agrees.
