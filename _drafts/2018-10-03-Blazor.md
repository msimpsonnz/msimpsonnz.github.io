title: Why Blazor is not yet another web framework (YAWF)
---

###This time it's different...I promise

It is 2018 and it seems like we get a new web framework every month and that always makes me think of [this](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f) article from 2016, but does an amazing job of setting the scene. One of my favorite tech quotes 'No JavaScript frameworks were created during the writing of this article' ha ha!

Anyway, onwards and upwards.

I've written about WebAssembly a while back but in case you don't know what I'm talking about you can find info [here](https://webassembly.org/).

[Blazor](https://blazor.net/) is the .NET implementation that allows use to run C# and HTML in the browser, using good old Razor Pages template language from ASP.NET!

But this is starting to pop up more and more, most recently [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com) announced you can use WebAssembly on their edge worker nodes for more complex edge computing scenarios, more [here](https://blog.cloudflare.com/webassembly-on-cloudflare-workers/).

### Back of the .NET

I started out working on MS Access and Visual Basic, I know...I'll be 40 next year! C# and ASP.NET was next so I am no stranger to some of this, but the JaveScript client side revolution passed me by I was still doing MVC, MVVM and Razor.

I've never been a UI person, I can definitely appreciate good design but most of my demos are for backend functional stuff, not showing reactive UI.
