### It's all in the name

So the title of this post has some levels, it makes reference to the Amazon origins of selling everything from A to Z. I wanted to use this a reference to my AWS journey and map all of the services and figure out how much I still had to learn. There isn't an AWS service starting with Z but with re:Invent just around the corner you never know. I'm planning on updating this post as I go so lets take a look.

### Automation is the name of the game

I decided to take some time and try and automate this journey. I have scraped the AWS Product page and built a little tool that looks at my blog site and matches the article tags with the service names and then updates this page with the markdown table below. Not bad, the code is [here](https://github.com/msimpsonnz/aws-misc/tree/master/svc-list).
