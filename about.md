I am a Technical Evangelist focusing on public cloud. I have over 15 years' experience in numerous technology aspects including software development and infrastructure. I have worked for several customers, partners and vendors, including Datacom and Microsoft.

At Microsoft I am a customer focused technologist, I help customers ensure they are maximising their investment in the Microsoft Cloud Platforms. I spend time building prototypes and MVP solutions to help customers quickly visualise and validate ideas. Recently, I have developed a number of intelligent applications using Natural Language Processing to assist with customer scenarios such as customer, call centre and internal IT operations.

People know me as a passionate techie, always striving to develop innovative solutions.

I am a Microsoft Certified Developer and AWS Certified Solution Architect. I am also a keen community advocate and currently co-host the [Auckland Azure Lunchtime Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Auckland-Azure-Lunchtime-Meetup/).
