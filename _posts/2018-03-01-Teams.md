## One UI to rule the all!!

Microsoft announced Teams almost a year ago and it's growth has been crazy!

I have been a long time Slack user as are many of my customers, so it has been an interesting transition. However, I've never been on the Slack paid plan so haven't had any exposure to those features.

As far as persistent chat features, there isn't too much to compare, the one feature I do prefer in Teams is conversations, I don't really the thread's in Slack.

I think the feature that I really like is the file integration and extensions to pull in different tools, so essentially we have a single UI to manage ALL the things.

We use this extensively for our team internally and the integration with Planner and OneDrive is great. We can all have a single view of chat, team files and task board from a single UI be that on desktop or mobile. This has really streamlined the way we work together, regardless of our current location.

The desktop client still needs some work, but I think that is down to Electron, at one stage it was the top resource consumer and leveraging the GPU in my badass Surface Book (Gen2), which was running full Visual Studio environment at the same time!

The `guest` access feature has been a long time coming and I think this will go a long way to increase adoption.
